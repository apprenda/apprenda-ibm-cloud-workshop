# Apprenda for IBM Cloud Workshop
Apprenda and IBM have partnered together to provide an experience native and natural for the Microsoft and .NET community. The Apprenda Platform integration is built using IBM Cloud tooling and with tooling on the Microsoft platform.  This is critical to ensure the solution is a true integration and not a bolt-on or afterthought. The solution is fully self-service with seamless onboarding. It’s a deep and rich experience for .NET developers.

Before the Apprenda on IBM Cloud solution, customers might have considered rewriting everything they had from the past decade.  Now, they can leverage their expertise and quickly move over existing and new .NET applications and immediately take advantage of numerous cloud capabilities.  High-availability, scalability and the ability to seamlessly tap into the full range of IBM Cloud services are a few notable examples. 

This workshop will walk you through configuring, deploying and scaling a .NET application in Apprenda running on the IBM Cloud.  Then, for bonus points, you’ll enhance that app with a Watson Conversation enabled chatbot! 

It’s important to note that you will be using an HTML portal throughout the workshop, but you could just as easily, if not in most cases easier, take advantage of a REST API, CLI or Microsoft Visual Studio integration.  To take that a step further, you could use TFS or any CI/CD tool to automate steps like these in your CI/CD process.  This is important because it allows you to take all the benefits from the Apprenda and IBM Cloud solution without having to change the tools you use or process you’re accustomed to.

## Part 1 – Upload and Deploy a .NET Application with Apprenda
### Upload .NET app using an Apprenda Archive 

#### 1. Navigate to the [Apprenda Developer Portal](https://apps.bm.apprenda.com) on IBM Cloud 
#### 2. Click **+New** button to open the application drawer and fill out a unique application name and description  
>You will notice the application alias is auto populated, you are able to change it if you like. (The alias is used by the platform to uniquely identify your application in the system and generate the URL used to access it.)
#### 3. Click Select File to bring up a file explorer menu and locate the Apprenda archive downloaded from the prerequisites
>**What is an Apprenda Archive?** Apprenda Archives are simply compressed ZIP (.zip) files that contain files organized in a pre-determined way. Apprenda uses this known structure to traverse the archive and extract information it uses to deploy your application. During the process of deployment, Apprenda first validates the contents of your archive against a set of rules that are designed to guarantee that your application will run properly on Apprenda in a secure and reliable fashion. Apprenda then extracts and catalogs your application’s files and resources and uses them as a foundation for serving your application to requesting Users.


#### 4. Finally select Save and Continue and Apprenda will upload the archive
>**What happens during upload?** During upload Apprenda will parse the archive structure to extract the various component tiers of your application and will statically analyze both the binaries and configuration of each to discover how your application components are related to one another. Apprenda creates a metadata map of your application that describes how the different tiers and components within tiers relate to one another. This map is useful to Apprenda in many different scenarios, including deployment and execution.  In fact, behind the scenes, Apprenda will use the same process when deploying your app.

>**What happens after upload?** After your archive is uploaded, parsed, and mapped Apprenda will create an application and place it in Definition Stage.  Then, you will be navigated to the Configure Tab of your application that Apprenda created.  This is where you can configure and enable different features of Apprenda for your app to take advantage of.  Configuration options include deployment settings, features that enable traditional applicaitons for the cloud and additional capabilities such as auth N/Z. 

>**What is Definition Stage?** This is one four stages:  Definition, Sandbox, Published, and Archived.  Each stage infers distinct characteristics about how your application is deployed and controls which operations can be conducted. We will learn more about the other stages as we progress through them.  For now, you can think of Definition as an app configuration stage, Sandbox as a deployed development/test stage and Published as a deployed production stage. The Definition stage is designed to allow you to provide information and configuration essential to the deployment of our application.  

#### Let’s move on to setting the amount of resource we want our app to have before we deploy it 

### Configure app’s Resource Policy
>**What are Resource Policies?** Resource policies determine the maximum resources (Memory and CPU) allowed for each deployed application component of your application (UI, Windows Service, database etc). For databases there is also what's called a Storage quota. A storage quota determine the maximum size of the database partitions claimed by your application. 

#### 1.	Click the Scale tab then the Policies sub-tab

>Here we can choose how much resources you want for each component of your application.  You’ll see all the components for your app in the drop-down box next to “Application Tier”. You’ll also notice a set of preconfigured sizes available to choose from on the right.  If you look at each component will see it is assigned a default size.  

#### 2. Drag your application component to the desired size of your choosing

>Remember, the larger the policy, the more expensive it is!  This should ideally be the near the amount of resource that this component can functionally run.  The default policy should work fine here.  If there’s more load, we can scale!  More on how we do that in Part 2.

### Promote app to Sandbox
>Now that we have successfully configured the size of our application components we’re ready to promote our application to the next Apprenda lifecycle stage. The Sandbox stage allows developers to test the application before it is made available to end users.

#### 1.	Click the Dashboard Tab
#### 2.	Click Promote button in the action bar on the bottom
#### 3.	Once promotion completes click Dashboard Tab
#### 4.	Click Launch from the action bar!

Let’s take a step back and realize what just happened. As a developer, you simply uploaded your application’s compiled binaries and gave Apprenda a few configuration parameters. The platform then grabbed your application, selected a back-end server to host it, copied the files over, injected additional configuration and libraries, and created an accessible URL that you can share automatically! Imagine what you could do if all your deployments could be this easy?

#### Let's move on to Part 2 to show capabilities this app has inherited by running on Apprenda!

## Part 2 – Configure Cloud Features: Monitoring, Scaling, Logging

### Monitoring your application

Now that your application is running, you can use Apprenda to monitor the individual components of your application.

#### 1. Navigate to the Dashboard of your application.
#### 2. Click the Monitor tab.
#### 3. Open With x 
#### 4. Change to real time
>You should be able to see the CPU and RAM utilization changing
#### 5. Navigate to the application do some actions or run 5 extra tabs to simulate load
#### 6. Look to see that load has happened 

>Monitoring the utilization of your application through the Apprenda Developer Portal provides a high-level view of your application’s health. You can quickly see the CPU and memory utilization for your application based on the resource policy assigned to it. 

### Update scaling strategy

Apprenda can scale your application’s individual components, allowing independent horizontal and vertical scaling.  This can be done in three ways (Manual, Automatic, and Scheduled).  These are used for the management of deployed instances of application components.

>MANUAL SCALING Allows you to explicitly set the exact deployed instance count of your app component. Apprenda will also enforce this number to ensure that you always have a consistent number of instances deployed.

>AUTOMATIC SCALING Set for an application component will cause the Apprenda platform to dynamically scale up or down the component's deployed instance count depending on CPU utilization levels tracked for currently deployed instances of that component. The deployed instance count will, however, always stay within a range that you set.

>SCHEDULED SCALING Allows you to set a weekly schedule that determines the deployed instance count for a given component. The instance count will be scaled up or scaled down at the time and day of the week specified to meet the count requirement specified by the schedule.

During this example, we’re going to scale our application’s UI to three instances. This will automatically update the Apprenda load-balancing tier, providing additional instances without any additional complex configuration or infrastructure provisioning.

#### 1.	Click the Scale tab
#### 2.	Click the “+” to open the manual scaling drawer
#### 3.	Input 3 in the instances field and Save
#### 4.	Navigate to the Monitoring tab  
>You’ll notice that the new instances are starting to be deployed and you will have three instances of your component running shortly. 

### Configure Log Override

Logging is a traditional and essential tool that assists in monitoring certain activities conducted by your application's users as well as debugging issues that arise during ordinary usage. Apprenda provides a centralized logging service that can be used by your application.  

>Our application uses the Log4NET logging framework. Apprenda automatically adds an appender, which forwards the application’s native logging to the Apprenda platform automatically. The Apprenda platform will capture the logs generated by the container.

#### 1.	From the Monitoring tab, click on the Applications Logs sub-tab
>The default global logging level is Error.  But you can set log level overrides to see the level of log messages appropriate for your application (Debug, Information, Warning, Error and Fatal).  
#### 2.	Select Log Overrides
#### 3.	Click +Create in the action bar then, select the Info Log Level, and then Apply
#### 4.	Click Back to go back to the Applications Logs and toggle Real Time to on so we will be able to see logs come in as they happen
#### 5.	In a separate tab Launch the app, play around a bit and you’ll start to see info level logs on the Application Logs page
