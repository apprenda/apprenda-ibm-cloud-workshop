# Apprenda for IBM Cloud Workshop
Apprenda and IBM have partnered together to provide an experience native and natural for the Microsoft and .NET community. The Apprenda Platform integration is built using IBM Cloud tooling and with tooling on the Microsoft platform.  This is critical to ensure the solution is a true integration and not a bolt-on or afterthought. The solution is fully self-service with seamless onboarding. It’s a deep and rich experience for .NET developers.

Before the Apprenda on IBM Cloud solution, customers might have considered rewriting everything they had from the past decade.  Now, they can leverage their expertise and quickly move over existing and new .NET applications and immediately take advantage of numerous cloud capabilities.  High-availability, scalability and the ability to seamlessly tap into the full range of IBM Cloud services are a few notable examples. 

This workshop will walk you through configuring, deploying and scaling a .NET application in Apprenda running on the IBM Cloud.  Then, for bonus points, you’ll enhance that app with a Watson Conversation enabled chatbot! 

It’s important to note that you will be using an HTML portal throughout the workshop, but you could just as easily, if not in most cases easier, take advantage of a REST API, CLI or Microsoft Visual Studio integration.  To take that a step further, you could use TFS or any CI/CD tool to automate steps like these in your CI/CD process.  This is important because it allows you to take all the benefits from the Apprenda and IBM Cloud solution without having to change the tools you use or process you’re accustomed to.
